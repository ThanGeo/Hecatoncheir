## üóíÔ∏è Requirements

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Hecatoncheir has been developed and tested on systems using the following versions:

- **MPICH** 4.0 or newer  
- **CMake** 3.10 or newer  
- **C++17** standard  
- **Boost** 1.71 or newer  
- **Ubuntu** 22.04

Earlier or later versions of these dependencies may also work, but they have **not been tested** and are not officially supported.

### üñ•Ô∏è Deployment

Hecatoncheir can be deployed on any cluster of machines or virtual machines (VMs) that already have **passwordless SSH** configured between all nodes.

Before proceeding with deployment, edit the contents of the `nodes` file located in the project‚Äôs root directory.  
Each line in this file should contain **exactly one** machine alias or IP address corresponding to a cluster node.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution** 
> The **first line** of the `nodes` file must specify the machine from which you will run Hecatoncheir (i.e., the **host node**).  
> This node should be the one you are currently connected to in the cluster.

**Example:**
```text
node1
node2
192.168.1.15
192.168.1.16
```


## üí° Getting Started

### üß© Installation

To install Hecatoncheir, simply run:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This script will compile Hecatoncheir and automatically synchronize the executables across all cluster nodes listed in the nodes file.

To build and enable Hecatoncheir‚Äôs **graphical user interface (GUI)**, use the following command instead:

```
./build-ui.sh
```

The GUI build requires several additional libraries and tools.  
The `build-ui.sh` script automatically downloads and installs (or updates) all required dependencies for you.  
The following components will be installed:


- **Ant Design** 5.26.0
- **React 19.1.0** and **React DOM 19.1.0** for the core React runtime
- **React Scripts 5.0.1** for build and development tools (Webpack, Babel, etc.)
- **TypeScript 4.9.5** for static typing
- **Ant Design 5.25.4** for UI components
- **Testing** Library for React component testing
- **Web Vitals 2.1.4** for web performance metrics
- Various **TypeScript** type definitions
- **Express 5.1.0**, the main Node.js web framework for API routing and middleware
- **CORS 2.8.5** for enabling cross-origin requests between frontend and backend
- **Multer 2.0.1** for handling file uploads
- **Path-to-Regexp 6.2.1** for the route pattern matching utility
- **Node.js** latest version

### üöÄ Run

All **Hecatoncheir** commands must be executed using MPICH‚Äôs `mpirun` (```mpiexec```) interface.  

To prevent conflicts between different MPI implementations (e.g., OpenMPI), always use ```mpirun.mpich``` instead of simply mpirun, ensuring that the MPICH library is used.

### üß™ Testing

To verify that Hecatoncheir was installed correctly and can be deployed across your cluster, run the provided test suite:

```
mpirun.mpich build/Hecatoncheir/test/test
```

If all tests <span style="color:green">PASS</span>, your installation is complete and ready to use!

### üíª Driver / C++ API

You can integrate Hecatoncheir into your own programs using its C++ API.  
Simply include the main header file:

```
#include <Hecatoncheir.h>
```

and link Hecatoncheir to your project through **CMake**.

Example `CMakeLists.txt` and `driver_template.cpp` files are provided in the `driver/` directory to demonstrate how to correctly include and link Hecatoncheir in your project.

A more detailed `driver.cpp` example is also available in the same directory, showcasing various usage scenarios of the C++ API.

Comprehensive class and method documentation including diagrams and code-level references is available on the project‚Äôs GitHub Pages:  
[https://thangeo.github.io/Hecatoncheir/index.html](https://thangeo.github.io/Hecatoncheir/index.html)

##### üîú Coming soon 
More detailed instructions for Hecatoncheir's C++ API and method calls. 

### üåç GUI

To use Hecatoncheir‚Äôs web-based graphical interface instead of its C++ API and avoid writing any code, run the `start-dev.sh` script generated by the `build-ui.sh` build process.

This script will automatically launch a web browser with Hecatoncheir‚Äôs GUI, allowing you to deploy it on your cluster, load data files, and execute queries entirely through the GUI using just your keyboard and mouse.
